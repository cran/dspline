Description: Discrete splines are a class of univariate piecewise polynomial
    functions which are analogous to splines, but whose smoothness is defined
    via divided differences rather than derivatives. Tools for efficient
    computations relating to discrete splines are provided here. These tools
    include discrete differentiation and integration, various matrix
    computations with discrete derivative or discrete spline bases matrices, and
    interpolation within discrete spline spaces. These techniques are described
    in Tibshirani (2020) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2003.03886>.
